    "**What is R-squared?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're trying to predict your friend's mood based on how many hours of sleep they got last night. R-squared is a number that tells you how much of their mood can be explained by just that one factor: sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a percentage:\n",
    "\n",
    "**100% R-squared (or 1.0):** This would mean that 100% of your friend's mood is perfectly explained by how much they slept. If they get 8 hours, they're always happy. If they get 4, they're always grumpy. It's a perfect relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "**0% R-squared (or 0.0):** This would mean that sleep has nothing to do with their mood. The R-squared value is 0 because there is no relationship between the two variables. Their mood is a coin toss, regardless of how much they slept.\n",
    "\n",
    "**70% R-squared (or 0.7):** This means that 70% of the ups and downs in your friend's mood can be explained by their sleep. The other 30% is due to other thingsâ€”maybe they had a bad day at school, or they're hungry.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In short, R-squared is a simple way to measure how well a model fits the data. The closer the number is to 1, the better your model is at explaining what's happening.**\n"
