    "What's a Confidence Interval? ü§î\n",
    "Imagine you want to know how many high schoolers prefer pizza over burgers. You can't ask every single high schooler in the world, right? That would take forever! So, you take a sample ‚Äì maybe ask 100 high schoolers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say in your sample of 100, 60% say they prefer pizza. Now, you might think, \"Great! 60% of all high schoolers prefer pizza.\" But is it exactly 60%? Probably not. Your sample is just a snapshot.\n",
    "\n",
    "A confidence interval is like saying, \"We're pretty sure the true percentage of all high schoolers who prefer pizza is somewhere between X% and Y%.\" It gives you a range, not just a single number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this: You throw a dart at a dartboard. You might not hit the bullseye every time, but you can say, \"I'm 95% confident my dart will land within this big circle around the bullseye.\" The big circle is your confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for our pizza example, we might say, \"We're 95% confident that between 50% and 70% of all high schoolers prefer pizza.\" This means if we took many, many samples, 95% of the confidence intervals we calculated would contain the true percentage of pizza lovers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaway: A confidence interval gives us a range where we're pretty sure the true value lies, based on our sample."

    "Simulating Data: We create true_preference which is the \"real\" (but unknown to us in a real scenario) percentage of high schoolers who prefer pizza each month. Then, we simulate taking a sample_size poll each month and getting pizza_lovers results, which gives us our sample_proportion.\n",

    "\n",
    "We use a confidence_level of 95%, which is very common.\n",
    "\n",
    "The z_score of 1.96 is a magic number for 95% confidence (it tells us how many standard deviations away from the mean we need to go to capture 95% of the data).\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculate the lower_bound and upper_bound of our interval using a formula that involves the sample_proportion, z_score, and sample_size. This formula is based on the idea that our sample proportion is an estimate of the true proportion, and we use the standard error to understand how much that estimate might vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotting: The blue line shows what our poll actually found each month. The light blue shaded area is our 95% confidence interval for each month. The dashed red line is the \"true\" preference (which we only know because we simulated it!). Notice how most of the time, the true preference falls within our confidence interval. This shows that the confidence interval is doing its job!"
